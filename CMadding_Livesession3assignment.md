### Questions
1.	 GitHub Cloning (20 points): Using Git, clone the following GitHub repository to your local machine: https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets.  In RMarkdown, please show the code (commented out, as it's not R syntax) that you used to create a new directory, navigate to the appropriate directory, and clone the repository to it.  One Git command per line, please.

git clone https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets.git



```r

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
